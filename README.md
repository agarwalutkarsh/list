# list

This is small project where you can list your items while going to market place or maybe you want to list some other things.
This uses HTML,CSS,JavaScript and also localStorage property which stores your data in your web browser only and not on server.They do not have any expiry date and 
always shows your stored info whenever it gets reloaded or you open your browser unless you clear all the data. 
It also has a Clear All Button(though of not very importance) which clears all the entries made by you.

Will update this as soon as i as i make any other changes.
